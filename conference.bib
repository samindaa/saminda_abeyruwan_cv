	Abstract = {Biped soccer robots have shown drastic improvements in motion skills over the past 
	few years. Still, a lot of work needs to be done with the RoboCup Federation's vision of 2050 
	in mind. One goal is creating a work ow for quickly generating reliable motions, preferably 
	with inexpensive and accessible hardware. Our hypothesis is that using Microsoft's Kinect 
	sensor in combination with a modern optimization algorithm can achieve this objective. We 
	produced four complex and inherently unstable motions and then applied three contemporary 
	optimization algorithms (CMA-ES, xNES, PSO) to make the motions robust; we performed 900 
	experiments with these motions on a 3D simulated Nao robot with full physics. In this paper we 
	describe the motion mapping technique, compare the optimization algorithms, and discuss various 
	basis functions and their impact on the learning performance. Our conclusion is that there is a 
	straightforward process to achieve complex and stable motions in a short period of time.},

	Abstract = {Collecting and maintaining accurate world knowledge in a dynamic, complex, 
	competitive, and stochastic environment such as RoboCup 3D Soccer Simulation is a challenging 
	task. Knowledge should be learned in real-time with time constraints. We use recently 
	introduced Off-Policy Gradient Descent algorithms in Reinforcement Learning that illustrate 
	learnable knowledge representations for dynamic role assignments. The results show that the 
	agents have learned competitive policies against the top teams from RoboCup 2012 for three vs 
	three, five vs five, and seven vs seven agents. We have explicitly used subset of agents to 
	identify the dynamics and the semantics for which the agents learn to maximize their 
	performance measures, and to gather knowledge about different objectives so that all agents 
	participate effectively within the team.},
